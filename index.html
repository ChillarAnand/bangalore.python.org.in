<p>The agenda was to contribute to open source projects. There were 53 participants. The event started with introduction about projects participants would like to work on. The participants were mix of beginners and experienced contributors. We had 5 mentors, <a href="http://muthukadan.net/">Baiju</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sivaa">Siva</a>, <a href="https://github.com/elvisds">Elvis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Krace</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been around 6 months, since we conducted Python 101 session. We felt it is good time to conduct one. Without any surprise it was very well received.</p>

<p>55 people attended the session.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/finiterecursion">Arun</a> handled morning session about <code>variables, conditions, loops, strings, functions and list</code>.</p>

<p>We had a great heavy Indian lunch and <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> resumed the session around 1.45 PM.<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> covered <code>inbuilt functions, dictionary, tuples, files, class, exception handling</code>.</p>

<p>The content was about what all goes into writing a web framework. It was targeted at people who already had some experience with using a framework. Starting off with the very basics oh handling a request and sending a response, the workshop was taken forward step by step.</p>

<p>There were about 45 participants for the workshop, one of them personally thanking Krace for all the workshops that he had done previously. Apparently after attending them and learning Python, he recently got a Python gig.</p>

<p>Towards the end, a copy of Two Scoops of Django and Python 101 were circulated among the participants. Some of the participants and organizers hung around to discuss about the upcoming <a href="http://in.pycon.org">Python India Conference</a> and the <a href="http://pythonexpress.in">Python Express</a> initiative.</p>

Following this, we had the volunteers meeting for <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2014/">InPycon</a> for which a few of the participants joined in as well.</p>

<p>The meetup was organized as a continuation to last month&#39;s beginner-level problem-solving Python workshop. As such, it focused on the following intermediate topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing functions as arguments to functions</li>
<li>Decorators</li>
<li>Introduction to classes</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Unit Testing</li>

<p>As was the case for the past couple of meetups, 50 people attended. The entire cafeteria got occupied and we had to pull in chairs around the area to accommodate those few who were late to join the party. Krace started off by doing a quick recap of what was covered during the last meetup. Making sure everyone was on the same page, he jumped into functions. Slowly building upon one function after the other, he hand held the crowd to be prepared for the scarier parts that were to follow.</p>

<p>By the time decorators came into the picture, everyone had their brains working high. After giving a quick peek, lunch was served around 1:00PM. In spite of the 1 hour lunch break, surprisingly, everyone finished off the Subway Burrito in a hurry, took a swing of the Mango Juice served along with it, and were ready by 1:30PM for the session to continue. Fed and their brain&#39;s chugging, we continued with decorators at 1:45PM.</p>

<p>Just before getting started, there was a special announcement. <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny">Daniel Roy Greenfeld</a>, the co-author of Two Scoops of Django, had donated a copy of the new edition of his book to Bangpypers. We decided that the best way for the community to use the book would be to pass it on from person to person every month. Upon collectively agreeing to this norm, the book was awarded to its first keeper, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>. Hopefully, the mantle will be passed on during each meetup from now on.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny">@pydanny</a> for giving two scoops to bangpypers.

<p>Finishing one part after the other, Krace made writing tests a parallel task from the beginning onwards. Giving a rock solid explanation on classes and its use, the workshop was concluded by 4:30PM. There were bonds strengthened, new friends made and good will spread around among the Puys all through the day. We shook hands and left, impatiently waiting for the next gathering.</p>

        <div class="item-body">
            <p>51 Puys! The greatest turnout yet. There was not event one chair left unoccupied in the hall. The enthusiasm of such a large crowd does give us all a hint about the demand in the industry for beginner level Python training. With the organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a> himself facilitating the workshop, the in-depth beginner level session was received by the crowd with much appreciation. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/171450392/">April Bangpypers meetup</a> happened at the Akamai office near Bellandur. <a href="https://twitter.com/k4rtik">Kartik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> came forward as volunteers. The session started at 10:30AM and concluded around 6:00PM.</p>

<p>Kicking off the workshop by getting to know the crowd better, Krace quickly got into the exercises, thereby getting everyone hands-on. The workshop was structured as a series of exercises in folder, along with their respective solutions in another. The material was shared in advance with the audience. The instructor went over each exercise (which were separated into individual files) by first demoing the concept using the Python interpreter and then letting the audience try it out within the file. You can find the course content comprising of the exercises and solutions <a href="https://github.com/kracekumar/pythonbyexamplestutorial">here</a>.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/m-BXqkrQVC/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>The session was riddled with questions from the participants. Being a man of patience, Krace took all of them, refined them and gave a solid explanation along with all the answers. We broke for lunch at about 1:30PM. Akamai was generous enough to sponsor huge mean boxes consisting of rice, curries, sweets and a pack of juice. We wrapped up luch by 2:30PM, at the point which Akamai gave us a short demo of their world wide service. All of us were taken into a room that resembled the cockpit of a spaceship where on a huge screen, you could see the globe rotating, having streaks of green and yellow depicting Akamai&#39;s realtime traffic, which apparently consisted of 40% of the world&#39;s!</p>

<p>The workshop resumed at 2:45PM, continuing from list, dictionaries, list &amp; dictionary comprehensions to files, error handling and standard libraries. The session covered all these and went on till about 6:00PM. Although that was more than the estimated time, the audience did not have the slightest of problems with the delay, due to the excellent workshop. Krace, having imparted the best practices, basic Python knowledge as well as the idiomatic approach to writing Python code, concluded his session by pointing them at other resources which they could follow up with as exercises.</p>

<p>At around 6:15, all of us parted, exchanging good-byes and wishing each other to meet within another month!</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Writing tests is an absolute waste of time&rdquo;, some of them say.</p>

<p>Well, we do not think so. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797622/">March Bangpypers meetup</a> was a hands on workshop covering TDD with Django. Just like last time, an enthusiastic crowd of 42 attended the session. It was held at the Apigee office in Koramangala. Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, the session started at around 10:30AM and went on till 3:30PM. Unlike the previous sessions, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a> was the only volunteer to help the participants.</p>

<p>The workshop started by telling everyone the importance of writing tests, the concept and theory of Test Driven Development and how it could help one tremendously while writing code. Although a bit hectic at first, it is a practice that would certainly pay off when it comes to catching the bugs in your code before it is deployed in production. <a href="https://github.com/sivaa/django-tdd">The Repo and the session notes can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The session focussed on using <strong>selenium</strong> for writing functional tests and the Python <strong>unittest</strong> library for writing unit tests. As you can see from the notes, each step was implemented step by step, one at a time making sure that the crowd was following along. The functional tests were bundled in a standalone package whereas the unittests were written within the tests.py file of the newly created Django app.</p>

<p>The concept of writing tests for a piece of code that was not written, was quite alien to almost all the participants. &ldquo;TDD is like martial arts&rdquo;, stated Siva towards the end. &ldquo;You cannot learn it in one day. First you have to go through all the troublesome exercises before getting to the actual kicking and punching part&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Making voluntary, common mistakes in his code, the instructor made the participant experience newbie mistakes that anyone could make. Thereby making them think it through and finding a solution. The well laid out exercise along with the elegant presentation imparted a great deal of knowledge to the attendees.</p>

<p>The workshop was wrapped up by 3:30PM after which, all of us hungout a bit talking to each other about different technologies and how they compare with each other. Certain participants had a couple of doubts about the session to be clearted who stuck with Siva for a while to get everything cleared.</p>

<p>By 4:15, all of us were on our ways, waiting to come together once more for the next meetup!</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797572/">February Bangpypers meetup</a> witnessed a whooping crowd of 46 Puys attending it. The LinkedIN office space where it was being held, had to be modified a little in order to accommodate everyone comfortably. The meetup was in the form a full-day hands on beginner level Python workshop. It was facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris Ibrahim K. V.</a> The agenda was to work through problems, thereby introducing and teaching Python. <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> and Souradeep came forward willingly to help the participants out whenever they had any doubt.</p>

<p>The workshop, which was supposed to commence at 10:00AM, got delayed by half an hour as people were pouring in one after the other. It started off by teaching everyone to <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">fly with Python</a> by importing &#39;antigravity&#39;. After the initial gimmick was done with, the customary &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; program was written, comparing it with the way it would be if this was a beginner Java or C workshop. God forbid.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kb9H-KNT4Q/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>The instructor used a library book storing application as an exercise that was continuously built upon during the duration of the course. He had another set of questions which were used to demonstrate and understand certain specific concepts. The audience had a mix of absolute Python beginners as well as others who had a little bit of experience using it. The willingness to learn along with their warm and friendly nature gave the gathering a pleasant atmosphere both in terms of learning Python as well as interacting during the session.</p>

<p>The topics covered included:<br>
* Working with the basic data types<br>
* Understanding Data structures well such as dictionaries, lists and tuples<br>
* Control flow statements including if, for loop and while loop<br>
* Writing functions and understanding parameter passing<br>
* File IO<br>
* A short introduction to writing classes</p>

<p>The workshop finished around 3:30PM. Everyone hung out for a while discussing the various areas where Python was used, the various resources to learn Python from followed by a short talk by LinkedIN on where they were using Python and how. Everyone collected the cool t-shirts LinkedIN was giving away and parted, looking forward to the next meetup.</p>

            <h3>Django unchained!</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797552/">January Bangpypers</a> meetup happened at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/yFcov">Apigee office</a>. The organizers, as a part of trying to improvise and improve the quality of the meetups, decided to do a full day session on using the Python Django framework. The trio of <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> were burdened with the responsibility of preparing the content and delivering the workshop. Siva put forward the idea of doing the tutorial in a step by step manner. He created the tutorial content on GitHub with a branch for each step. Find the repo <a href="https://github.com/sivaa/django-workshop">here</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/k4rtik">Kartik</a> accompanied the team to help out the participants.</p>
<h2>Workshop</h2>
<p>The workshop commenced at 10:30AM with around 25 participants.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> kicked off by introducing Django, its features and its structure. He further dived down deep into describing the various settings as well sa workflow possible thereby imparting a solid structure to the participants. He wound up his instroductory session at around 11.15AM.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTKlvGLQTc/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Next up, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> who had to handle the first and second tutorials. Enlightening the crowd with the customary &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application, he started by explaining how the different parts of a Django project tied together. He explained and demonstrated by giving a hands on session regarding writing a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; app. He presented both the approach of directly returning a response as well as using a template in order to render the HTML. He finished off his session in about an hour.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTJWcTrQSI/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Just before lunch break, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a> took the stage and introduced the flow and structure of the third tutorial. Once everyone got the idea of what was coming, the gathering took a break for lunch at 1:00PM and had some awesome pizzas sposored by <a href="http://apigee.com/about/">Apigee</a>. Everyone got back together at 1:45PM and the session commenced. He had explained each step of his tutorial one by one in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/sivaa/8486393">gist</a>. This helped the participants a lot in terms of getting together their bearings once things went too far for them to follow.</p>

<p>Demoing and giving a hands on workshop covering each step one by one, he imparted a clear view of how Django worked, how they could do useful things and how to carry it on forward. The concept of views, forms, models, templating engine, MVT as well validation were covered with simple but non-trivial examples. He concluded his session by 3.15PM by giving a few advices on best practices to follow.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTTpkFrQaq/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Sayan again took the stage in order to explain in detail the admin features as well about the templating. He went on explaining about how the admin would automatically generate fields for all the models written in a particular Django project to how the templating engine works. Its capabilities, features and best practices of using it. He finished off the last part around 4.315PM.</p>

<p>By this time, the audience were really interested to know more about and around the Python community. They had been really interactive during the workshop, following each line, asking doubts and making sure they learnt whatver was being taught. Towards the end, questions, both related to Django as well as Python started pouring in. It was a wonderful time where the instructors as well as [Krace][], the main organizer, addressed each of their queries one by one.</p>

<p>Questions regarding flask v/s Django, Django ORM, static files, templating engine, deployment, learning curve and a lot more were asked and discussed. The meeting was adjourned at 5PM and everyone parted to their own ways after exchanging good byes.</p>

Instead of just the usual 3 hour meetup, this time, we had a beginner level Python workshop in the morning which almost the same number of people attended.</p>
<h2>Workshop</h2>
<p>The workshop commenced at 10:00AM and was facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a>. After introudcing Python, he dived deeper into it with hands on exercises for basic strings, data structures and conditions. The session was very interactive and it came to and end at 1:45PM.

<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>After finishing the workshop as well as lunch, everyone gathered back at the TW hall around 3PM and the sessions started at around 3:20PM.</p>

<p>The sessions kicked off with <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a>&#39;s introduction to iPython. He started off by explaining the various difficulties that users face while fiddling around with the normal Python shell, multiline editing being the major bottle neck. He went one explaining the myriad of features that came with iPython that helped make life much easier.<br>
Auto-completion, iPython notebook, running system command from within the interpreter, getting help for the objects, and ended with displaying <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/">nbviewer</a>, where you could share your iPython notebooks as gists. You can find his notebook <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/kracekumar/8059932">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="https://twitter.com/shoaibnajeeb">Shoaib Najeeb</a> with his talk on using Cassandra from Pycassa. It was quite an elaborate talk where he started right from the basics explaining the NoSQL database layout contrasting it with the RDBMS ones. After having gotten everyone on the same page with the Cassandra basics, he then moved onto explaining the CAP theorem as well as the configuration required on Pycassa to get it up and running. The session was extremely interactive where he was bombarded with questions, all of which he replied to to the best of his knowledge. As time was running out, leaving his audience thirsty for more, he concluded his session by 5:40PM. The link to his presentation will be updated soon.</p>

<p>To end the day&#39;s fireworks, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/fayaz">Fayaz</a> presenting his session on logging. He started off from the basics, explaining the need for logging in any project that was going into production. Moving forward by sharing some of his insights into the best practices of using logging, he introduced various features that came with the library. He also mentioned some useful utilities such as the Redis Handler, the FingersCrossedHandler as well as the TicketingHandler. Having convinced his audience to go back and get started with logging, he wound up his session by 6:15PM, thereby bringing the meetup to an end. His presentation shall be shared soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended and let&#39;s keep the ball rolling folks!</p>

<p>During recording  audio input was mistakenly connected to audio output of<br>
the lecture recorder, as a result audio for Siva&#39;s session was lost.<br>
Unfortunately camera backup of the video was delayed in recording and only<br>
speaker face was focused, as a result video is now unusable. Sorry :-(.</p>
